Grand Theft Auto V map using Leaflet

I couldnt find any interactive maps that use the in-game coordinate system and I needed it for development work in FiveM.
This map's basemap is one that I found linked on reddit, link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/3zccne/gta_v_gtao_gridded_map_with_coordinates_xpost/

TODO:
- Add the ability to read a CSV file of points
- Read an uploaded CSV file
- Add other map layers, especially the high res satellite map (going to see if I can add the coordinate grid to that as well)
